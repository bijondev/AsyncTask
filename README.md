# AsyncTask
Android AsyncTask 


AsyncTask is a class in the Android framework that allows you to perform tasks in the background and publish the results on the UI thread. It is a useful way to perform long-running tasks that shouldn't block the UI, such as networking operations or file I/O.

Here is an example of how to use AsyncTask in an Android app:
```
private static class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {

    private WeakReference<Activity> activityWeakReference;

    MyAsyncTask(Activity activity) {
        activityWeakReference = new WeakReference<>(activity);
    }

    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(Void... voids) {
        // Perform some background task, such as downloading data from the internet
        return "Result from the background task";
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        Activity activity = activityWeakReference.get();
        if (activity == null || activity.isFinishing()) {
            return;
        }

        // Update the UI with the result from the background task
        TextView textView = activity.findViewById(R.id.text_view);
        textView.setText(result);
    }
}
```
To start the AsyncTask, call the execute() method:
```
new MyAsyncTask(this).execute();
```
The AsyncTask has three generic types:

    Params, the type of the parameters passed to the task when it is executed.
    Progress, the type of the progress units published during the background computation.
    Result, the type of the result of the background computation.

In the example above, the AsyncTask has no parameters, progress units, or a result, so the types are all set to Void.

I hope this helps give you an idea of how to use AsyncTask in an Android app! Let me know if you have any questions.
